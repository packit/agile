# Packit team roles

In our team, we have a few statically assigned roles but as much as possible is shared within a team in the form of weekly-rotated roles. We don't rotate the roles of Product Owner and Technical Leader to give the team a long-term perspective. Having both a Product Owner and a Technical Leader allows us to balance the user-targeted view with the implementation perspective. Despite of having those two roles assigned, everyone is welcome to help (e.g. Community Shepherd helps with the daily communication with our users).

## Product Owner

The role of the Product Owner is here to represent the user perspective and make sure the work being done by the team benefits our users. They also define the vision and high-level architecture of the project. The main liaison with stakeholders and consumers.

## Technical Leader

A technical leader understands the project and all its parts to an extent to be able to make technical decisions or drive the team to make them in a timely and reasonable manner. Responsible for the technical solution being scalable, efficient and secure. Works with PO on breaking down epics into smaller tasks. Responsible for tracking the development status and making sure things go hand in hand with the quarterly plans.

## Weekly roles

Here are the roles that are rotated each week.
(Check [this page](./weekly-roles) for the automation we use for it.)
The specific tasks are defined in the form of [issues](https://github.com/packit/agile/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroles).

:::note
This is our specific and currently used setup tweaked to our needs and the current number of team members.
We update this now and then but the basic structure and idea stay the same.
